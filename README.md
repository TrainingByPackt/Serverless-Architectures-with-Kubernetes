# Serverless-Architectures-with-Kubernetes
Learn how to build and manage serverless applications in cloud and on-premise Kubernetes clusters with examples and best practices straight from the frontline.
This course will address the widespread challenges faced by both junior and seasoned developers who are working on Serverless Architectures with Kubernetes. Cutting-edge Kubernetes platforms and serverless frameworks such as Kubeless, Apache OpenWhisk,  OpenFass and Funktion  will provide the tooling to help you with serverless applications on Kubernetes and you will learn to choose the framework for your upcoming project.
After an accelerated, hands-on overview of serverless architecture and Kubernetes concepts, we’ll cover a wide range of real-world development challenges faced by real-world developers, and explore various techniques to overcome them. You’ll learn how to create production-ready Kubernetes clusters and run serverless applications on them.
As a broad coverage to Serverless Architectures with Kubernetes, any prior experience with Docker, Kubernetes and hands-on experience with a popular programming language will be useful, but not required for progression.
